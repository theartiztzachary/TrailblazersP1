#Test Strategy Document

###Naming Conventions
1. No abbreviations (example: first_name instead of fir_na).

###Reporting and Fixing Bugs
1. Bugs should be reported via GitHub's Issues framework.
2. Title/comments should be formatted as follows
   1. Title: [Critical Level Name] - Module Name
   2. Comments: Error Message, Line Number, Initial Thoughts on 'Why'
   3. Assignees: Assign yourself, or reach out for help and assign others.
      1. Make sure other people know that they're being assigned to a bug.
3. Critical Level Definitions:
   1. Not Critical, more Quality of Life oriented
   2. Critical, but does not impede standard operating procedures
   3. Highly Critical, impedes standard operating procedures
4. Fix things from the highest critical level to the lowest critical level.
5. For this project, do not create sub-branches for bugfixing. However, branches must be bug free before they are
   merged into the main branch.
6. Once the bug is fixed, comment briefly how it was fixed, then click 'Close Issue with Comment' on the GitHub Issues page. 

###API Endpoints
